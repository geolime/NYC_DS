Case Review


# Technologies

BigQuery

# Task
# Task 1: Explore and understand the dataset
## 1. What is the most popular station and end station?
## 2. What is the gender distribution of Citibike users?
## 3. What is the trip duration distribution of Citibike trips?
## 4. Were there new bike stations introduced or removed at any point in time? What makes you think there were or weren't?

# Task 2: Insights about areas in NYC
The task is very open: Imagine being a Data Scientist at either NY Citibikes or e.g. the city of
New York, and your team lead has asked you to find interesting insights (preferably actionable)
about areas in NYC. We encourage you to use supplementing data sets to the Citibikes dataset,
many can be found readily available on BigQuery.

NB: We expect that you use the dataset creatively. All assumptions donâ€™t have to make 100%
sense but we expect you to be able to describe why you used the data in the way you did.
